<div data-label="567433"> <b>Overview and results of our procedure: </b>First, the HBN data set was rated by 4 neuroimaging experts to create a “gold standard” subset of data. Next, the 3D MRI scans were converted into 2D axial brain slices, which were loaded onto braindr (<a href="https://braindr.us">https://braindr.us</a>), a web application to crowdsource the quality ratings. Area under the curve of a the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated for the average citizen scientist quality rating for each slice. Compared to an expert-labeled test set, this resulted in an AUC of 0.95. In an effort to remove unreliable citizen scientists, the ratings were aggregated by fitting a model that weights each citizen scientist contribution to the slice score by how much that individual’s scores match those of the experts. &nbsp;The resulting AUC was  0.97. Finally, the 2D brain slices together with the weighted citizen scientist  ratings were used to train a neural  network. In an ROC analysis on left out data, the AUC of these predictions was 0.99. </div>
