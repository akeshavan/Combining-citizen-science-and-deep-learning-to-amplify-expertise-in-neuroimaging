<div data-label="182176"><b>Impact of quality control on effect size estimates:&nbsp;</b>Results of quality control on the inferred association between gray matter volume and age during development. Part A shows the relationship when all data is used in the ordinary least squares (OLS) model. Part B shows the new OLS model when data is thresholded by the deep learning modelâ€™s predicted braindr rating at 0.7. The effect size nearly doubles when QC scores are taken into account.
