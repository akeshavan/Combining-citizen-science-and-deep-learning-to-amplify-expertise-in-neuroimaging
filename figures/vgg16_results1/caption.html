<div data-label="258547"><b>Deep learning training and evaluation on the left out test set:&nbsp;</b>Part A shows the training and validation loss scores for 10 training runs, each with a different initialization seed. The training loss tends towards 0 but the validation loss plateaus between 0.05 and 0.07 mean squared error at the 10th epoch. Part B shows the ROC curve of the prediction on the test set against the binary classified gold-standard slices, along with the ROC curves computed from previous analysis (the average citizen scientist rating, and the XGBoosted ratings).<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></div>
