<h1 data-label="408498" class="ltx_title_section">Discussion</h1><div></div><div>We have developed a system to scale expertise in brain MRI quality control through citizen science amplification combined with deep learning (via CNNs). We have validated our method against MRIQC, a specialized tool that already exists for this particular use&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Esteban2017}</cite>. Unlike MRIQC, our method is able to generalize beyond the classification of T1-weighted images; any image-based binary classification task can be loaded onto the Braindr platform, and crowdsourced via the web. We have also demonstrated the importance of scaling QC expertise  by showing how replication of a previously established result (gray matter volume over time during development) depends on a researcher's decision on data quality. In the following sections, we  1) discuss the impact of the internet and web-applications for collaboration, 2) review research on MRI quality control,  3) review research on brain development, 4) discuss limitations of our method, and 5) propose future directions.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="240928" class="ltx_title_subsection">The Internet and Web Applications for Collaboration&nbsp;</h2><div>The internet and web browser are not only crucial for scientific communication, but also for collaboration and distribution of work.
