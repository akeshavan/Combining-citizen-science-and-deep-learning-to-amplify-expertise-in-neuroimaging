<h1 data-label="408498" class="ltx_title_section">Discussion</h1><div></div><div>We have developed a system to scale expertise in brain MRI quality control through citizen science amplification combined with deep learning (via CNNs). We have validated our method against MRIQC, a specialized tool that already exists for this particular use&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Esteban2017}</cite>. Unlike MRIQC, our method is able to generalize beyond the classification of T1-weighted images; any image-based binary classification task can be loaded onto the Braindr platform, and crowdsourced via the web. We have also demonstrated the importance of scaling QC expertise  by showing how replication of a previously established result (gray matter volume over time during development) depends on a researcher's decision on data quality. In the following sections, we  1) discuss the impact of the internet and web-applications for collaboration, 2) review research on MRI quality control,  3) review research on brain development, 4) discuss limitations of our method, and 5) propose future directions.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="240928" class="ltx_title_subsection">The Internet and Web Applications for Collaboration&nbsp;</h2><div>Web-based  tools such as&nbsp;BrainBox&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{heuer2016open}</cite>&nbsp;and Mindcontrol&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Keshavan2017}</cite> can  facilitate the collaboration  of experts in image segmentation and quality control, creating annotated datasets that are large enough to train CNNs. In order to simplify the task for citizen scientists, we developed a web application called braindr&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{keshavan2018}</cite>, which reduces the time-consuming task of slice-by-slice 3D inspection to a quick decision made on a 2D slice. With braindr, citizen scientists amplified the initial expert-labelled dataset.</div><div></div><div></div><h2 data-label="638082" class="ltx_title_subsection">MRI Quality Control</h2><div></div><h2 data-label="451824" class="ltx_title_subsection">Brain Morphometry During Development</h2><div></div><h2 data-label="679893" class="ltx_title_subsection">Limitations</h2><ul><li>citizen scientists were primarily neuroimagers</li><li>still, a tendency for false positives</li><li>to extend beyong</li></ul><h2 data-label="404417" class="ltx_title_subsection">Future Directions</h2><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="986206" class="ltx_title_section">Methods</h1><div></div><div></div>
