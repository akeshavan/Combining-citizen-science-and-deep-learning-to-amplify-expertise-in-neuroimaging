For this proof of concept, we studied brain development. In&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{ducharme2016trajectories}</cite>, the authors found that QC had a significant impact on the  estimates of&nbsp; the trajectory of cortical thickness during development. They concluded that post-processing QC (i visual inspection) is required for such studies.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><ul><li>Paragraph on brain development, big picture findings (wealth of papers) -- clearly QC has am impact as shown in figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{612467}</span></li></ul><div></div>
