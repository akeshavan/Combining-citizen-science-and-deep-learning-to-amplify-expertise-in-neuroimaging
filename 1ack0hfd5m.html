For this proof of concept, we studied brain development.  In&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{lebel2011longitudinal}</cite>, the authors found white matter increases and gray matter decreases equal in magnitude, resulting in no overall brain volume change. From the second figure in their manu, we estimate an effect of&nbsp; -4.3 cm<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>per year of gray matter volume change during development (estimated as            (710-580)/(5-35) from the second figure in their manuscript). In Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{612467}</span>, we present an interactive plot, where readers can threshold data points based on QC scores from the predicted labels of the CNN (called "Braindr ratings"), or on MRIQC XGBoost probabilities (called "MRIQC ratings"). Depending on the threshold chosen, the effect  of gray matter volume over age varies from -2.6 cm<sup>3</sup>/year (with no threshold) to -5.3 cm<sup>3</sup>/year (with Braindr rating &gt; 0.9). A  threshold of 0.7 of either Braindr or MRIQC&nbsp;results in an effect size around -4.3 cm<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;per year, replicating the results of&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lebel2011}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
