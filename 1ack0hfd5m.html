For this proof of concept, we studied brain development. In&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{ducharme2016trajectories}</cite>, the authors found that QC had a significant impact on their&nbsp; estimates of&nbsp; the trajectory of cortical thickness during development. They concluded that post-processing QC (in the form of visual inspection) is required for such studies, especially due to motion artifacts  in younger children. In&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{lebel2011longitudinal}</cite>, the authors found white matter increases and gray matter decreases equal in magnitude, resulting in no overall brain volume change. From their figure, we estimate an effect of&nbsp; -4.4 cm<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>per year of gray matter during development.
