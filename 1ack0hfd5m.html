<h2 data-label="933181" class="ltx_title_subsection">Aggregating Citizen Scientist Ratings to Emulate  Expert Labels</h2><div>Due to the varying skill levels of the citizen scientists, we trained a model to aggregate labels  based on the rater, in order to create more optimal labels. We used the XGBoost algorithm&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Chen2016}</cite>, an ensemble method that combines a set of weak learners (decision trees) to predict the "gold" standard labels based on a set of features, which were the average rating of the image from each rater.
