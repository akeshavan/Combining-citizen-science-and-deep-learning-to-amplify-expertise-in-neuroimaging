For this proof of concept, we studied brain development. In&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{ducharme2016trajectories}</cite>, the authors found that QC had a significant impact on their&nbsp; estimates of&nbsp; the trajectory of cortical thickness during development. They concluded that post-processing QC (in the form of visual inspection) is crucial for such studies, especially due to motion artifacts  in younger children. In&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{lebel2011longitudinal}</cite>, the authors found white matter increases and gray matter decreases equal in magnitude, resulting in no overall brain volume change. From their figure, we estimate an effect of&nbsp; -4.4 cm<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>per year of gray matter during development. In Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{612467}</span>, we present an interactive plot, where readers can threshold data points based on QC scores from the predicted labels of the CNN (called "Braindr ratings"), or on MRIQC XGBoost probabilities (called "MRIQC ratings"). Depending on the threshold chosen, the effect  of gray matter volume over age varies from -2.6 cm<sup>3</sup>/year (with no threshold) to -5.3 cm<sup>3</sup>/year (with Braindr rating &gt; 0.9). A  threshold of 0.7 or either Braindr or MRIQC&nbsp;results in an effect size of -4.4 cm<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;per year, replicating the results of&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lebel2011}</cite></div><div></div>
