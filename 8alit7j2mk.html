<div>All images were then converted into a set of 2D axial slices using the NiBabel python library and uploaded to <a href="https://braindr.us">https://braindr.us</a>. Two images of the 724 were corrupted, so the total image count became 722 images. Five slices, spaced 40 slices apart from each other, were selected from each brain, where the first slice was one that had over 10,000 non-zero pixels. One subject (sub-NDARVJ504DAA) had only 4 slices because the last slice did not meet the 10,000 pixel threshold. The total number of slices uploaded to <a href="https://braindr.us">https://braindr.us</a>&nbsp;was 3609.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The braindr application was written in Javascript using the Vue.js (<a href="https://vuejs.org">https://vuejs.org</a>) framework. Google Firebase (<a href="https://firebase.google.com/">https://firebase.google.com/</a>) was used for the realtime database.he slices were hosted on Amazon S3.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
