<div>Transfer learning is another broadly applicable deep learning technique, where a number of layers from pretrained network are retrained  for a different use case, which can drastically cut down the training time and labelled dataset size needed&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{ahmed2008training,pan2010survey}</cite>. For example, the same transfer learning approach was used for brain MRI tissue segmentation (gray matter, white matter, and CSF) and for multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{van2015transfer}</cite>. Yet despite these&nbsp;advances in deep learning, a non-trivial amount of labelled data is still required to train CNNs, and we return to the original problem: how does a single expert create an annotated dataset that is  large enough to be amenable for a deep learning approach? </div><div></div><div>In this study, we assert that citizen scientists can learn from expert decisions and amplify these decisions, to the extent where deep learning approaches become feasible. As a proof of concept, we apply this approach to brain MRI quality control (QC): a binary classification task where images are labelled "pass" or "fail" based on image quality.&nbsp;QC is a paradigmatic example of the problem of scaling expertise. QC is subjective, and each researcher has their own standards as to which images pass or fail on inspection. This variability as a result of expert subjectivity has problematic effects on downstream analyses, especially statistical inference. The est effect sizes are&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>because it affects the&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>: subjective, each researcher has their own standards â†’ different effect size.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Web-based  tools such as&nbsp;BrainBox&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{heuer2016open}</cite>&nbsp;and Mindcontrol&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Keshavan2017}</cite> can  facilitate the collaboration  of experts in image segmentation and quality control, creating annotated datasets that are large enough to train CNNs. In order to simplify the task for citizen scientists, we developed a web application called braindr&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{keshavan2018}</cite>, which reduces the time-consuming task of slice-by-slice 3D inspection to a quick decision made on a 2D slice. With braindr, citizen scientists amplified the initial expert-labelled dataset. We show that even though citizen-scientist amplification is not quite as accurate as expert decisions, a deep learning approach trained on the amplified dataset can still match state of the art software for image quality control.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div>
