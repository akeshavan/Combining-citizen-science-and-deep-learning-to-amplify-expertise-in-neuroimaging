<div>Transfer learning is another broadly applicable deep learning technique, where a number of layers from pretrained network are retrained  for a different use case, which can drastically cut down the training time and labelled dataset size needed&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{ahmed2008training,pan2010survey}</cite>. For example, the same transfer learning approach was used for brain MRI tissue segmentation (gray matter, white matter, and CSF) and for multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{van2015transfer}</cite>. Yet despite these&nbsp;advances in deep learning, a non-trivial amount of labelled data is still required to train CNNs, and we return to the original problem: how does a single expert create an annotated dataset that is  large enough to be amenable for a deep learning approach? </div><div></div><div>We assert that citizen scientists can learn from and amplify expert decisions, to the extent where deep learning approaches become feasible. As a proof of concept, we apply this approach to brain MRI quality control (QC): a binary classification task where images are labelled "pass" or "fail" based on image quality.&nbsp;QC is a paradigmatic example of the problem of scaling expertise. QC is subjective, and each researcher has their own standards as to which images pass or fail on inspection. The variability of expert subjectivity has problematic effects on downstream analyses, especially statistical inference. Effect size estimates depend on the input data  to a statistical model, so varying QC criteria will add more uncertainty to these estimates, and might result in replication failures. It is therefore essential that we develop systems that can accurately emulate decisions, and that these systems are made openly available for the scientific community.</div><div></div><div>For this proof of concept, we  developed a citizen-science amplification and CNN procedure for the openly available Healthy Brain Network dataset.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Healthy Brain Network&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{alexander2017open}</cite>&nbsp;Initiative aims to collect and publicly release data on 10,000 children over the next 6 years to facilitate the study of brain development and mental health through transdiagnostic research. The rich dataset includes MRI brain scans, EEG and eye tracking recordings, extensive behavioral testing, genetic sampling, and voice and actigraphy recordings. In order to understand the relationship between brain structure measured from MRI and behavior (EEG, eye tracking, voice, actigraphy, behavioral scores)</div><div></div><div>We also demonstrate how choice of QC threshold is related to the effect size estimate on the association between age and brain tissue volumes during development.</div><div></div><div>In this study, we show that our generalizable approach of  deep learning  trained on a crowd-amplified dataset matches state-of-the-art software built specifically for image QC <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{esteban2017mriqc}</cite>.  We therefore recommend employing our crowd-amplification method for any  binary image classification task, particularly in the cases where specialized, fully automated software do not  exist.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h1 data-label="904357" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div></div><h1 data-label="408498" class="ltx_title_section">Discussion</h1><div></div><h1 data-label="986206" class="ltx_title_section">Methods</h1><div></div><h1 data-label="795074" class="ltx_title_section">Acknowledgements</h1><div></div><div></div><h3>extra paras ???</h3>
