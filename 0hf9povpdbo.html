<div>Transfer learning is another broadly applicable deep learning technique, where a number of layers from pretrained network are retrained  for a different use case, which can drastically cut down the training time and labelled dataset size needed&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{ahmed2008training,pan2010survey}</cite>. For example, the same transfer learning approach was used for brain MRI tissue segmentation (gray matter, white matter, and CSF) and for multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{van2015transfer}</cite>. Yet despite these&nbsp;advances in deep learning, a non-trivial amount of labelled data is still required to train these algorithms well, and we return to the original problem: how does an expert create an annotated dataset that is  large enough to be amenable for a deep learning approach?</div><div></div><div>In this study, we assert that citizen scientists can learn from expert decisions and amplify these decisions, to the&nbsp;</div><div> </div><div></div>
