<div>Transfer learning is another broadly applicable deep learning technique, where the last layer of a pretrained network (for an entirely different purpose) is retrained (i.e. transfered) for a different use case , which can drastically cut down the training time and labelled dataset size needed for biomedical image tasks. For example, the same transfer learning approach was used for brain</div><div> </div><div></div>
