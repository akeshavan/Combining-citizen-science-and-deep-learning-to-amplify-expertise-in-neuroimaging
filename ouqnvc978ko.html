<h2 data-label="152075" class="ltx_title_subsection">Training Deep Learning to Automate Image Labeling</h2><div>The deep learning model was trained to predict the XGBoosted labels that were based on crowd ratings.&nbsp;We loaded the pretrained VGG16 network&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{simonyan2014very}</cite>, removed the top layer, and then trained&nbsp; a final layer dense layer followed by a single node output layer. The training of the final layer was run for 50 epochs and the best model on the validation set was saved. We ran this model 10 separate times, each time with a different random initialization seed, in order to measure the variability of our ROC AUC on the test set. We found that after 10 epochs,</div>
