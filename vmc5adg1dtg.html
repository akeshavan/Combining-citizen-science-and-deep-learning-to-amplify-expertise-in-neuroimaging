We selected a subset of users who rated the gold standard slices in the top 75th percentile in number of ratings. This reduced the dataset to 65 users who submitted 68,314 total ratings, 18,940 of which were on the 1000 gold standard slices. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{358654}</span> shows the distribution of average ratings and the distribution of number of ratings per slice on the gold standard dataset.</div>
