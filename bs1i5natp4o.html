For this proof of concept, we studied brain development, which is the primary focus on the HBN dataset. Lebel and colleagues &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lebel2011}</cite> found that increases in white matter volume and decreases in gray matter volume are roughly equal in magnitude, resulting in no overall brain volume change over development in late childhood. Based on Figure 2 in the Lebel manuscript&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lebel2011}</cite>, we estimate an effect of&nbsp; approximately -4.3 cm<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;per year - a decrease in gray matter volume over the ages measured (See Figure 2 in the their manuscript; we estimate the high point to be 710 cm<sup>3</sup> and the low point to be 580 cm<sup>3</sup> with a range of ages of approximately 5 years to 35 years and hence: (710-580)/(5-35) = -4.3 cm<sup>3</sup>/year). To reproduce their analysis and assess the effect of using the CNN-derived quality control estimates, we estimated gray and white matter volume in the subjects that had been scored for quality using our algorithm. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{182176}</span> shows gray matter volume as a function of age. Two conditions are compared: in one &nbsp;(Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{182176}</span>A) all of the subjects are included, while in the other only subjects that were passed by the CNN are included (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{182176}</span>B, blue points). Depending on the threshold chosen, the effect of gray matter volume over age varies from -2.6 cm<sup>3</sup>/year (with no threshold) to -5.3 cm<sup>3</sup>/year (with Braindr rating &gt; 0.9). A threshold of 0.7 of either Braindr or MRIQC&nbsp;results in an effect size around -4.3 cm<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;per year, replicating the results of&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lebel2011}</cite>.&nbsp;A supplemental interactive version of this figure allows readers to threshold data points based on QC scores from the predicted labels of the CNN (called “Braindr ratings”), or on MRIQC XGBoost probabilities (called “MRIQC ratings”). Thus, quality control has a substantial impact on estimates of brain development and allowing poor quality data into the statistical model can almost wipe out developmental changes in gray matter volume.</div><div></div>
