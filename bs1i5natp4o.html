For this proof of concept, we studied brain development. In</b>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{lebel2011longitudinal}</cite>,&nbsp;<b>the authors found that the increases in white matter volume and the decreases in gray matter volume are roughly equal in magnitude, resulting in no overall brain volume change. Based on the Lebel  manuscript, we estimate an effect of&nbsp; approximately -4.3 cm3&nbsp;per year - a decrease in gray matter volume over the ages measured (See Figure 2 in the their manuscript; we estimate the high point to be 710 cm3 and the low point to be 580 cm3 with a range of ages of approximately 5 years to 35 years and hence: (710-580)/(5-35) = -4.3 cm3/year). To reproduce their analysis and assess the effect of using the CNN-derived quality control estimates, we estimated gray and white matter volume in the subjects that had been scored for quality using our algorithm.</b>  Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{182176}</span>, <b>shows gray matter volume as a function of age. Two conditions are compared: in one (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{182176}</span></b>A) <b>all of the subjects are included, while in the other only subjects that were passed by the CNN are included (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{182176}</span></b>B, blue points).&nbsp;<b>Depending on the threshold chosen, the effect of gray matter volume over age varies from -2.6 cm3/year (with no threshold) to -5.3 cm3/year (with Braindr rating &gt; 0.9).
