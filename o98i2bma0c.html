<div>Web-based  tools such as&nbsp;BrainBox&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{heuer2016open}</cite>&nbsp;and Mindcontrol&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Keshavan2017}</cite> can  facilitate the collaboration  of experts in image segmentation and quality control, creating annotated datasets that are large enough to train CNNs. In order to simplify the task for citizen scientists, we developed a web application called braindr&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{keshavan2018}</cite>, which reduces the time-consuming task of slice-by-slice 3D inspection to a quick decision made on a 2D slice. With braindr, citizen scientists amplified the initial expert-labelled dataset. </div>
