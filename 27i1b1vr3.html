There were 724 T1-weighted images. All procedures were approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board (IRB). Mindcontrol raters, who were all neuroimaging researchers with substantial experience in similar tasks, provided informed consent, including consent to&nbsp;publicly release these ratings. Mindcontrol raters were asked to pass or fail images after inspecting the full 3D volume, and provide a score of their confidence on a 5 point Likert scale, where 1 was the least confident and 5 was the most confident. Mindcontrol raters received a point for each new volume they rated, and a leaderboard on the homepage displayed rater rankings. The ratings of the top 4 expert raters (including the lead author) were used to create a gold-standard subset of the data.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="581898" class="ltx_title_subsection">"Gold-Standard Selection</h2><div>The gold standard subset of the data was created by selecting images that were confidently passed or confidently failed (confidence &gt; 4) by the 4 expert&nbsp; raters. In order to measure reliability between expert raters, the ratings of the second, third, and fourth expert expert rater were recoded to a scale of -5 to 5 (where -5 is confidently failed, and 5 is confidently passed). An ROC analysis was performed against the binary ratings of the lead author on the commonly rated images, and the area under the curve (AUC) was computed for each pair. An average AUC, weighted by the number of commonly rated images between the pair, was 0.97, showing good agreement between expert raters. The resulting gold standard dataset consisted of 200 images. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{169530}</span> shows example axial slices from the gold standard dataset.&nbsp;The gold standard dataset set contains 100 images that were failed by experts, and 100 images that were passed by experts.</div>
