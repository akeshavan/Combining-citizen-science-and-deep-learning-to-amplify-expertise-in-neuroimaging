<div>At the outset, a group of neuroimaging experts created a gold-standard quality control dataset on a small subset of the data (n=200), through extensive visual examination of the full volumes of the data. In parallel, citizen scientists were asked to "pass" or "fail" two dimensional axial slices from the full dataset (n=722) through a web application that could be accessed through a desktop, tablet or mobile phone  (<a href="https://braindr.us">https://braindr.us</a>). Amplified labels, that range from 0 (fail) to 1 (pass), were generated in 2 ways. First, by taking the average citizen-scientist rating for each slice. Second, by generating a probability score from a gradient-boosting classifier (XGBoost) trained to predict the label membership of each image, with all of the user's ratings as features. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated for both the averaged ratings and the classifier probability outputs, and the area under the  curve (AUC) was computed. The AUC for the average crowd ratings was 0.95, and the AUC for the XGBoost probabilities was 0.97 on a validation set. Next, a transfer learning regression was trained to predict the XGBoost probability score from the two dimensional axial slices. The AUC for the predicted labels on a left out dataset was 0.99. As a validation, another XGBoost classifier was trained on the features of the MRIQC algorithm, and the AUC for the validation set&nbsp; was also 0.99.&nbsp;</div>
